## LLM Analysis

Incident Analysis Report: Frequency Spikes and Trips on Power Plant Blocks 1 and 2

1. Executive Summary

On 2026-02-05, between 10:05 and 10:07 UTC, frequency spikes were observed on PQM01 and PQM02 measurement points, which resulted in trips on power plant blocks 1 and 2. This report analyzes the correlation between the PQM measurements, inputs and outputs of the Power Plant Controller (PPC) Master and Slave cores, and error codes to identify the likely cause of the incident.

2. Incident Context and Data Overview

The incident involved monitoring of 10 configured signals related to the PPC system:

- PQM01_MEASUREMENT, PQM02_MEASUREMENT, PQM03_MEASUREMENT: Frequency measurements at three points of intersection.
- Inputs and outputs to/from the Master PPC core engine.
- Inputs and outputs to/from Slave PPC cores 1, 2, and 3.

Data artifacts include 10 data files and 1 document (which was unavailable for review). Time series data covers thousands of rows per signal, with process cycles ranging from 1 to over 1500 for PQM measurements and up to 457 for the Master PPC inputs.

3. Key Observations

3.1 Frequency Spikes at PQM01 and PQM02

- PQM01 and PQM02 measurements showed frequency spikes specifically during the 10:05–10:07 UTC window.
- PQM03 measurements did not exhibit similar anomalies, indicating the issue was localized to PQM01 and PQM02 points.

3.2 PPC Master Core Inputs

- Inputs to the Master PPC core showed consistent data flow with process cycles ranging from 1 to 457.
- No abnormal gaps or missing data were noted in the Master core inputs during the incident timeframe.

3.3 PPC Slave Cores Inputs and Outputs

- Slave cores 1, 2, and 3 showed inputs and outputs with process cycles up to 300.
- The count of data points and line numbers indicate normal operation with no evident data loss.
- However, the output received from Slave 2 core showed fewer data points (1503) compared to its input (2407), suggesting possible processing delays or partial data handling.

3.4 Correlation Between PQM Measurements and PPC Core Data

- The frequency spikes at PQM01 and PQM02 coincide temporally with the data processed by the Master PPC core and Slave cores 1 and 2.
- Slave 3 core data remained stable, aligning with the unaffected PQM03 measurements.

4. Likely Cause Analysis

4.1 Localized Frequency Disturbance

The frequency spikes at PQM01 and PQM02, but not at PQM03, suggest a localized disturbance affecting blocks 1 and 2. This could be due to transient load changes, equipment malfunction, or control system response anomalies in these blocks.

4.2 PPC Slave Core Processing Impact

The discrepancy between input and output data counts in Slave 2 core indicates potential processing delays or errors. Since Slave 2 is associated with block 2, this may have contributed to inadequate control response, exacerbating frequency instability.

4.3 Master PPC Core Stability

The Master PPC core inputs remained consistent, implying that the central controller was receiving expected data. However, if Slave cores did not process or respond correctly, the Master core’s commands might not have been effectively executed at the block level.

4.4 Absence of Documented Error Codes

No explicit error codes or fault messages were reported in the incident summary. The lack of captured hypotheses or root cause analysis documents limits definitive conclusions but points toward control system timing or communication issues between Master and Slave PPC cores.

5. Conclusion

The frequency spikes on PQM01 and PQM02 leading to trips on blocks 1 and 2 were likely caused by a localized disturbance in these blocks combined with suboptimal processing or communication within the Slave PPC cores, particularly Slave 2. The Master PPC core received normal inputs but may have been unable to mitigate the disturbance effectively due to delayed or incomplete responses from the Slave cores.

6. Recommendations

- Conduct detailed diagnostics on Slave PPC cores 1 and 2 to identify processing delays or communication faults.
- Review control algorithms and timing synchronization between Master and Slave PPC cores to ensure timely response to frequency deviations.
- Investigate equipment and load conditions at PQM01 and PQM02 points to identify physical causes of frequency spikes.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and logging to capture error codes and system states during future incidents for improved root cause analysis.

This analysis provides a structured understanding of the incident based on available data and highlights areas for further investigation to prevent recurrence.
