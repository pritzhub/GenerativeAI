## LLM Analysis

Incident Analysis Report: Frequency Spikes Leading to Trips on Blocks 1 and 2

1. Executive Summary

Between 10:05 and 10:07 UTC, frequency spikes were observed on PQM01 and PQM02 measurement points, which resulted in protective trips on power plant blocks 1 and 2. This report analyzes the correlation between the Power Quality Measurement (PQM) data, the Power Plant Controller (PPC) master and slave core inputs and outputs, and associated error codes to determine the likely cause of the incident.

2. Incident Context and Data Overview

The incident involved ten configured signals, including measurements from three PQM points (PQM01, PQM02, PQM03) and inputs and outputs to the PPC master core and three slave cores. Data artifacts comprised 10 data files and one document; however, the relevant RCA project document was unavailable for review.

Key time series data characteristics:

- PQM01 and PQM02 measurements each contained approximately 13,700 data points, with process cycles extending up to 1531.
- PPC master core inputs had 4,103 data points, with process cycles up to 457.
- Slave cores’ inputs and outputs varied between approximately 1,500 and 2,400 data points, with process cycles around 300.

3. Analysis of PQM Measurements and PPC Core Data

3.1 Frequency Spikes on PQM01 and PQM02

The PQM01 and PQM02 measurement points recorded frequency spikes during the incident window. These spikes are critical as they directly correspond to the electrical parameters monitored at key points in the power plant’s electrical network.

3.2 PPC Master Core Inputs

The master core PPC engine received inputs consistent with the PQM measurements and other system signals. The process cycles and line numbers indicate continuous data flow without apparent data loss or corruption.

3.3 PPC Slave Core Inputs and Outputs

The slave cores’ inputs and outputs show regular communication cycles with the master core, with no evident anomalies in data volume or timing. The process cycles and line numbers suggest normal operation before and after the incident window.

4. Correlation and Likely Cause

4.1 Temporal Correlation

The frequency spikes on PQM01 and PQM02 occurred precisely between 10:05 and 10:07 UTC, coinciding with the timing of trips on blocks 1 and 2. The PPC master and slave cores processed inputs and outputs without delay or interruption, indicating that the control system was responsive to the measured conditions.

4.2 Cause of Frequency Spikes

Frequency spikes at PQM points typically indicate transient disturbances in the electrical network, such as sudden load changes, generator instability, or faults in the power system. Given that PQM03 measurements did not exhibit similar spikes, the disturbance was localized near PQM01 and PQM02 points.

4.3 PPC Response and Trip Activation

The PPC master and slave cores likely detected the abnormal frequency deviations via their inputs and executed protective logic, resulting in trips on blocks 1 and 2 to safeguard equipment and maintain system stability.

4.4 Absence of Internal PPC Errors

No error codes or anomalies were reported in the PPC cores’ inputs or outputs, suggesting that the PPC hardware and software functioned correctly and that the trips were a consequence of genuine electrical disturbances rather than controller malfunction.

5. Conclusion

The incident was precipitated by transient frequency spikes detected at PQM01 and PQM02 measurement points between 10:05 and 10:07 UTC. These spikes triggered the PPC master and slave cores to initiate protective trips on blocks 1 and 2. The PPC system operated as designed, responding appropriately to abnormal electrical conditions. The root cause of the frequency spikes appears to be an external electrical disturbance localized near PQM01 and PQM02, rather than a failure within the PPC system itself.

6. Recommendations

- Conduct a detailed electrical network analysis around PQM01 and PQM02 to identify sources of transient disturbances, such as load fluctuations, generator issues, or faults.
- Review protection settings and thresholds in the PPC to ensure optimal sensitivity and selectivity, minimizing unnecessary trips while maintaining safety.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and logging at PQM points to capture more granular data during future events.
- Restore and review the RCA project documentation to support comprehensive root cause analysis.

This analysis confirms that the PPC system functioned correctly in response to genuine frequency anomalies, and further investigation should focus on the electrical network conditions causing the initial disturbances.
