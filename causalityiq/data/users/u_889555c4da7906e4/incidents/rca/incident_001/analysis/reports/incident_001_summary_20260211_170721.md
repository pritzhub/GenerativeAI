## LLM Analysis

Incident Analysis Report: Frequency Spikes and Resulting Trips on Power Plant Blocks 1 and 2

1. Executive Summary

Between 10:05 and 10:07 UTC, frequency spikes were observed on PQM01 and PQM02 measurement points, which correspond to critical points of intersection in the power plant’s electrical system. These anomalies precipitated trips on blocks 1 and 2, causing an operational disruption. This report analyzes the correlation between the PQM measurements, the Power Plant Controller (PPC) Master and Slave cores’ inputs and outputs, and error codes to identify the likely root cause of the incident.

2. Incident Context and Data Overview

The incident involved ten configured signals, including measurements from PQM01, PQM02, and PQM03, as well as inputs and outputs exchanged between the PPC Master core and three Slave cores. Data artifacts comprised ten data files and one document, although the key document (RCA Projects Record 1) was unavailable for review.

Key time series data points include:

- PQM01 and PQM02 measurements showed frequency spikes during the incident window.
- Inputs to the PPC Master core and Slave cores, as well as outputs from the Slave cores, were recorded with consistent row counts and process cycles, indicating normal data flow outside the incident window.
- PQM03 measurements did not exhibit similar anomalies, suggesting the issue was localized to PQM01 and PQM02.

3. Detailed Analysis

3.1 PQM Measurement Correlation

PQM01 and PQM02 are critical measurement points reflecting frequency stability at key intersections in the power plant’s electrical network. The frequency spikes recorded between 10:05 and 10:07 UTC indicate transient disturbances or oscillations in the power system. The absence of similar spikes at PQM03 suggests the disturbance was confined to the segments monitored by PQM01 and PQM02.

3.2 PPC Master and Slave Core Inputs and Outputs

The PPC system architecture involves a Master core coordinating with multiple Slave cores to manage power plant operations. Inputs sent to the Master core and Slave cores, as well as outputs received from the Slave cores, were analyzed for anomalies.

- The data shows consistent counts and process cycles for inputs and outputs, with no evident data loss or communication failures.
- The timing of inputs and outputs aligns with normal operational cycles, indicating that the PPC system was actively processing data during the incident.
- No error codes or exceptions were reported in the available data, suggesting that the PPC cores did not detect internal faults.

3.3 Correlation Between PQM Spikes and PPC Data

The frequency spikes at PQM01 and PQM02 coincided temporally with the trips on blocks 1 and 2. Given that the PPC inputs and outputs remained stable and error-free, it is likely that the PPC system responded appropriately to the detected frequency anomalies by initiating protective trips to safeguard the plant equipment.

4. Likely Cause of the Problem

Based on the correlation of data, the most probable cause of the incident is an external disturbance or transient event affecting the electrical network segments monitored by PQM01 and PQM02. This disturbance caused frequency spikes that triggered protective trips on blocks 1 and 2.

The PPC system functioned as designed, processing inputs and coordinating outputs without internal errors. Its protective logic likely initiated the trips in response to the abnormal frequency measurements to prevent damage or instability.

Potential sources of the disturbance could include:

- Sudden load changes or faults in the connected grid.
- Equipment malfunction or switching operations near PQM01 and PQM02 points.
- External environmental factors impacting power quality.

Further investigation into grid conditions and equipment status at the time of the incident is recommended to pinpoint the exact origin of the frequency spikes.

5. Recommendations

- Conduct a detailed review of grid events and equipment logs around 10:05–10:07 UTC to identify external causes.
- Verify the calibration and health of PQM01 and PQM02 sensors to rule out measurement errors.
- Review protective relay settings and PPC trip logic to ensure optimal sensitivity and selectivity.
- Enhance monitoring and alerting mechanisms for early detection of frequency anomalies.

6. Conclusion

The incident involving frequency spikes at PQM01 and PQM02 led to protective trips on blocks 1 and 2. Analysis indicates that the PPC system operated correctly, responding to genuine frequency disturbances rather than internal faults. Addressing external factors and verifying sensor integrity will be critical to preventing recurrence.

This concludes the incident analysis report. Further data and documentation, when available, will support a more comprehensive root cause analysis.
