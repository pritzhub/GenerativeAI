## LLM Analysis

Incident Analysis Report: Frequency Spikes Impacting Power Plant Controller (PPC) and Resulting Trips on Blocks 1 and 2

1. Executive Summary

Between 10:05 and 10:07 UTC, frequency spikes were detected on PQM01 and PQM02 measurement points, which subsequently caused trips on power generation blocks 1 and 2. This report analyzes the correlation between the PQM measurements, inputs and outputs of the PPC Master and Slave cores, and associated error codes to identify the likely root cause of the incident.

2. Incident Context and Data Overview

The Power Plant Controller (PPC) system comprises a Master Core and multiple Slave Cores (Slave 1, Slave 2, Slave 3) responsible for monitoring and controlling power generation blocks. The PQM (Point of Intersection) measurements provide critical frequency data at various points in the power plant.

During the incident timeframe, the following signals were monitored:

- PQM01_MEASUREMENT and PQM02_MEASUREMENT: Frequency data at points 1 and 2, respectively.
- Inputs and outputs to/from the Master Core PPC engine.
- Inputs and outputs to/from Slave 1, Slave 2, and Slave 3 PPC engines.

A total of 10 configured signals and 11 artifacts (10 data files and 1 document) were analyzed. Unfortunately, the relevant RCA document was not available for review.

3. Analysis of PQM Measurements

The PQM01 and PQM02 measurements showed notable frequency spikes precisely during the incident window (10:05–10:07 UTC). These spikes represent sudden deviations from nominal frequency values, which are critical parameters for stable power generation.

- PQM01_MEASUREMENT data count: 13,719 samples.
- PQM02_MEASUREMENT data count: 13,744 samples.

The frequency spikes at these points indicate abnormal fluctuations in the electrical grid or generation output, which can trigger protective mechanisms.

4. Correlation with PPC Master and Slave Core Inputs and Outputs

The PPC Master Core receives inputs from various sensors and measurement points, processes control algorithms, and sends commands to Slave Cores managing individual blocks.

- Input sent to Master Core PPC engine: 4,103 samples.
- Inputs and outputs for Slave Cores ranged between approximately 1,494 to 2,407 samples.

The data shows consistent communication between the Master and Slave cores, with process cycles ranging from 1 to over 450 for the Master and up to 300 for Slaves, indicating normal operational cycles.

However, during the incident timeframe, the inputs to the Master Core would have included the anomalous frequency data from PQM01 and PQM02. The Master Core likely processed these spikes as abnormal conditions, triggering control commands to the Slave Cores.

The Slave Cores, upon receiving these commands, would have attempted to adjust generation parameters to stabilize frequency. The outputs from the Slave Cores reflect these control actions.

5. Error Codes and Trip Events

While specific error codes were not explicitly provided in the data, the incident summary confirms that trips occurred on blocks 1 and 2. Trips are protective shutdowns initiated to prevent equipment damage or unsafe operating conditions.

The frequency spikes at PQM01 and PQM02 likely exceeded predefined thresholds, causing the PPC to initiate trips on the affected blocks. This is consistent with the control logic designed to protect the plant from frequency instability.

6. Likely Root Cause

Based on the correlation of data:

- The frequency spikes at PQM01 and PQM02 were the initiating events.
- These spikes were detected by the PPC Master Core through its input signals.
- The Master Core processed these anomalies and communicated corrective commands to Slave Cores.
- The Slave Cores attempted to respond but were unable to stabilize the frequency within safe limits.
- Protective trip mechanisms activated on blocks 1 and 2 to prevent damage.

The root cause is therefore attributed to transient frequency disturbances at critical measurement points (PQM01 and PQM02), which propagated through the PPC system and resulted in protective trips.

7. Recommendations

- Investigate the source of frequency spikes at PQM01 and PQM02, which could be due to grid disturbances, generation load changes, or sensor anomalies.
- Review PPC Master and Slave Core control algorithms to ensure appropriate filtering and response thresholds to transient events.
- Enhance monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and mitigate frequency deviations before trips occur.
- Conduct a detailed root cause analysis once the missing RCA document is available.

8. Conclusion

The incident involving frequency spikes at PQM01 and PQM02 led to trips on blocks 1 and 2 through the PPC system’s protective mechanisms. The PPC Master and Slave Core inputs and outputs reflect a coordinated response to these anomalies. Addressing the underlying causes of the frequency disturbances and refining PPC control strategies will be essential to prevent recurrence.

---

This concludes the incident analysis report. Further investigation is recommended to fully resolve the root cause and implement corrective actions.
