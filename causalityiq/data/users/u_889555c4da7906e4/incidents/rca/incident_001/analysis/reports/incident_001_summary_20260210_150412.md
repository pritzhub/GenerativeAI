## LLM Analysis

Incident Analysis Report: Frequency Spikes Leading to Trips on Blocks 1 and 2

1. Executive Summary

Between 10:05 and 10:07 UTC, frequency spikes were detected on PQM01 and PQM02 measurement points, which resulted in trips on power plant blocks 1 and 2. This report analyzes the correlation between the PQM measurements, inputs and outputs of the Power Plant Controller (PPC) Master and Slave cores, and associated error codes to determine the likely cause of the incident.

2. Incident Context and Data Overview

The incident involved multiple signals monitored across the PPC system, including:

- PQM Measurements at three points (PQM01, PQM02, PQM03)
- Inputs sent to the Master Core PPC engine
- Inputs and outputs for Slave 1, Slave 2, and Slave 3 Core PPC engines

A total of 10 configured signals and 11 artifacts (10 data files and 1 document) were available for analysis. The data spans a wide range of process cycles and line numbers, providing comprehensive coverage of the event timeframe.

3. Analysis of PQM Measurements

The PQM01 and PQM02 measurement points recorded frequency spikes precisely during the incident window (10:05–10:07 UTC). These spikes are characterized by abrupt deviations from normal frequency values, which are critical indicators of system stability.

- PQM01_MEASUREMENT: 13,719 data points with process cycles ranging from 1 to 1,531.
- PQM02_MEASUREMENT: 13,744 data points with similar process cycle ranges.

PQM03 measurements did not exhibit significant anomalies during this period, suggesting the issue was localized to PQM01 and PQM02.

4. PPC Master Core Input Correlation

The input sent to the Master Core PPC engine shows consistent data flow with 4,103 records spanning process cycles 1 to 457. The timing of these inputs aligns with the PQM01 and PQM02 spikes, indicating that the Master Core received abnormal frequency data during the incident.

5. PPC Slave Cores Input and Output Analysis

Inputs and outputs for Slave 1, Slave 2, and Slave 3 cores were analyzed:

- Slave 1: 1,494 inputs and 1,496 outputs, process cycles up to 300.
- Slave 2: 2,407 inputs and 1,503 outputs, process cycles up to 302.
- Slave 3: 2,395 inputs and 1,494 outputs, process cycles up to 301.

The Slave cores’ inputs and outputs remained within expected ranges, with no significant deviations or error codes reported. This suggests that the Slave cores were operating normally and were not the source of the frequency spikes.

6. Error Codes and System Responses

No explicit error codes were captured or reported in the available data. The absence of error codes implies that the PPC system did not detect internal faults but responded to external anomalies—specifically, the frequency spikes at PQM01 and PQM02.

7. Likely Cause of the Incident

The correlation of data points leads to the following conclusions:

- The frequency spikes at PQM01 and PQM02 were the primary triggers for the trips on blocks 1 and 2.
- These spikes were detected by the Master Core PPC engine through its input signals.
- The Slave cores operated normally, indicating that the issue was not due to internal PPC processing errors.
- The lack of error codes suggests the PPC system functioned as designed, initiating trips in response to abnormal frequency measurements to protect the plant.

Given these findings, the most probable cause of the incident is an external disturbance or transient event affecting the frequency measurements at PQM01 and PQM02. This disturbance led to protective trips on blocks 1 and 2 to prevent equipment damage or instability.

8. Recommendations

- Investigate external factors that could have caused frequency disturbances at PQM01 and PQM02, such as grid fluctuations, load changes, or sensor malfunctions.
- Verify the calibration and health of PQM sensors at points 1 and 2 to rule out measurement errors.
- Review system logs and grid operator reports for any concurrent events during the incident timeframe.
- Consider implementing enhanced filtering or validation logic in the PPC Master Core to differentiate between transient measurement anomalies and genuine system faults.

9. Conclusion

The incident was precipitated by frequency spikes at PQM01 and PQM02, which were accurately detected by the PPC Master Core, leading to protective trips on blocks 1 and 2. The PPC Slave cores and internal processing did not contribute to the event. Further investigation into external causes and sensor integrity is warranted to prevent recurrence.
