STATE OF ILLINOIS REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL ILLINOIS POWER AGENCY PROFESSIONAL SERVICES - ELECTRICITY PROCUREMENT PLANNING Reference Number 15-RFP-01

The Illinois Power Agency (“IPA,” “Agency,” or “State”) is issuing this request for proposal (“RFP”) seeking qualified and responsible experts or expert firms (“Offerors”) to assist the Agency with the development of power supply procurement plans. A brief background and description is set forth below, followed by detailed requirements. The Agency welcomes responses from qualified Offerors able and willing to meet these requirements. Only proposals from short-listed respondents to 15-RFQ-01 that successfully passed the review screen provided in 20 ILCS 3855/1-75(a) shall be considered responsive to this RFP.

BACKGROUND: The Agency serves as the procurement authority for electricity delivered to bundled rate customers of Commonwealth Edison (“ComEd”) and Ameren Illinois Company (“Ameren”), per the Illinois Power Agency Act (20 ILCS 3855/1-5 et seq.) and Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act (220 ILCS 5/16-111.5).¹ The Illinois Power Agency Act states that “The Agency shall each year, as needed, issue a request for qualifications for experts or expert consulting firms to develop the procurement plans in accordance with Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act.” After the issuance of a request for qualifications (“RFQ”) and a determination of qualified firms, Section 1-75(a)(4) of the Illinois Power Agency Act provides that “The Agency shall issue requests for proposals to the qualified experts or expert consulting firms to develop a procurement plan for the affected utilities...”

After the IPA’s prior issuance of an RFQ, this RFP solicitation represents the second step in the process of retaining an expert or expert consulting firm. If selected through the RFP process, the selected Offeror will be expected to enter into a binding contract with the Agency.

Pursuant to Section 1-25(2) of the Illinois Power Agency Act (20 ILCS 3855/1-25(2)), this solicitation is exempt from the standard procurement process outlined in the Illinois Procurement Code and instead features the “alternative bidding procedures” described under Section 1-75(a) of the IPA Act as authorized by Section 20-10(i) of the Illinois Procurement Code (30 ILCS 500/20-10(i)).

Brief Description: The Agency seeks a power supply procurement planning consultant (“Consultant”). The Consultant will primarily assist the Agency in developing its annual procurement plan as described under Section 1-75(b) of the IPA Act (20 ILCS 3855/1-75(b)). The Agency’s power supply procurement plans outline the procurement of the electricity and renewable energy resources requirements for bundled rate customers of Ameren, ComEd, and any other utilities which may require the services of the Agency. The Consultant, with input from the Agency and or the electric utilities, will be required to complete at least the following tasks.

Analyze the projected balance of supply and demand for eligible retail customers over a 5-year period.
Identify the wholesale products to be procured following plan approval by the Illinois Commerce Commission.
¹ The Agency also can serve this function for Illinois utilities with fewer than 100,000 customers upon their request. The IPA understands that MidAmerican Energy may for the first time make this election for the upcoming planning year.

Vendor may view the full text at (www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs.asp). Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act (20 ILCS 3855/1-75) and Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act (220 ILCS 5/16-111.5) are applicable to this solicitation.

I.8 PUBLIC RECORDS AND REQUESTS FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT: Proposals become the property of the Agency. Proposals, including late submissions will not be returned. All proposals will be open to the public under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 ILCS 140) and other applicable laws and rules, unless Offeror requests in its proposal that the Agency treat certain information as confidential. A request for confidential treatment will not supersede the State’s legal obligations under FOIA. The Agency will not honor requests to keep entire proposals confidential. Offerors must show the specific grounds in FOIA or other laws or rules that support confidential treatment. Regardless, the Agency will disclose the successful Offeror’s name, and the substance of the proposal upon final contract award. If Offeror requests confidential treatment, Offeror must submit one additional copy of the proposal with proposed confidential information redacted. This redacted copy must describe the general nature of the material removed, and shall retain as much of the proposal as possible. In a separate attachment, Offeror shall supply a listing of the provisions identified by section number for which it seeks confidential treatment and identify the statutory basis under Illinois law and include a detailed justification for exempting the information from public disclosure. Offeror will hold harmless and indemnify the Agency for all costs or damages associated with the Agency defending Offeror’s request for confidential treatment. Offeror agrees the Agency may copy the proposal to facilitate evaluation, or to respond to requests for public records. Offeror warrants that such copying will not violate the rights of any third party.

I.9 RESERVATIONS: Offeror must read and understand the solicitation and tailor the proposal and all activities to ensure compliance. The Agency reserves the right to amend the solicitation, reject any or all proposals, cancel the solicitation, and waive minor defects. The Agency may request a clarification, inspect Offeror’s premises, interview staff, request a presentation, or otherwise verify the contents of the proposal, including information about subcontractors and suppliers. The Agency will make all decisions on compliance, evaluation, terms and conditions, and shall make decisions in the best interests of the Agency and in accordance with rules and other applicable state and federal statutes and regulations. This competitive process may require that Offeror provide additional information and otherwise cooperate with the Agency. If an Offeror does not comply with requests for information and cooperate, the Agency may reject the proposal as non-responsive to the solicitation. Submitting a proposal does not entitle Offeror to an award or a contract. Posting Offeror’s name in a Bulletin notice does not entitle Offeror to a contract. The Agency is not responsible for and will not pay any costs associated with the preparation and submission of any proposal. Short listed Offeror(s) for contract award shall not commence, and will not be paid for any billable work prior to the date all parties

If the Agency issues an award, the award will be made to the responsive offeror whose proposal best meets the specified criteria. However, if the Agency does not consider the Offeror’s price and or exceptions to the State of Illinois Solicitation and Contract Terms and Conditions (Attachment DD) to be fair and reasonable and negotiations fail to meet acceptable terms, the Agency reserves the right to cancel the award and take appropriate action to meet the needs of the Agency. The Agency will determine whether the price and terms are fair and reasonable by considering the proposal, including the Offeror’s qualifications, the Offeror’s reputation, all prices and exceptions submitted, the project budget, and other relevant factors.

MINORITY, FEMALE, PERSONS WITH DISABILITY STATUS PARTICIPATION AND UTILIZATION PLAN

ATTACHMENT NN

The Business Enterprise Program Act for Minorities, Females and Persons with Disabilities (BEP) (30 ILCS 575) establishes a goal for contracting with businesses that have been certified as owned and controlled by persons who are minority, female or who have disabilities.

Contract Goal to be achieved by the Vendor: This contract includes a specific Business Enterprise Program (BEP) utilization goal of 20% of the contract amount and is based on the availability of certified vendors to perform the anticipated direct subcontracting opportunities of this contract. In addition to the other award criteria established for this contract, the Agency/University will award this contract to a Vendor that meets the goal or makes good faith efforts to meet the goal. This goal is also applicable to change orders and allowances within the scope of work provided by the certified vendor.

Following are guidelines for the Vendor’s response in the Utilization Plan. A format for the utilization plan is included in this section. Vendor should include any additional information that will add clarity to the Vendor’s proposed utilization of certified vendors to meet the targeted goal. The Utilization Plan must demonstrate that the Vendor has either met the contract goal or that it has made good faith efforts to do so.

At the time of proposal submission, the Certified Vendor may not yet be certified with CMS Business Enterprise Program; however, the Certified Vendor must meet the eligibility requirements and be fully certified in the BEP Program before contract award. Visit (www.sell2.illinois.gov/bep/Business_Enterprise.htm) for complete requirements and to apply for certification in the Business Enterprise Program. Vendors who submit bids or proposals for State contracts shall not be given a period after the bid or proposal is submitted to cure deficiencies in the Utilization Plan and the Letter of intent, unless mandated by federal law or regulation (30 ILCS 575(4)(c).

If applicable, the Plan should include an executed Joint Venture agreement specifying the terms and conditions of the relationship between the partners and their relationship and responsibilities to the contract. The joint venture agreement must clearly evidence that the certified vendor will be responsible for a clearly defined portion of the work and that its responsibilities, risks, profits and contributions of capital and personnel are proportionate to its ownership percentage. It must include specific details related to the parties’ contributions of capital, personnel and equipment and share of the costs of insurance and other items; the scopes to be performed by the certified vendor’s own forces and under its supervision; and the commitment of management, supervisory personnel and operative personnel employed by the certified vendor to be dedicated to the performance of the contract. Each joint venture partner must execute the proposal to the Agency.

An agreement between a Vendor and a certified vendor in which the certified vendor promises not to provide subcontracting quotations to other vendors is prohibited. The Agency may request additional information to demonstrate compliance. The Vendor agrees to cooperate promptly with the Agency in submitting to interviews, allowing entry to places of business, providing further documentation, or soliciting the cooperation of a proposed certified vendor. Failure to cooperate may render the proposal non-responsive. The contract will not be finally awarded until the Vendor’s Utilization Plan is approved.

ATTACHMENT NN

Certified Vendor Locator References: Vendors may consult CMS' BEP Certified Vendor Directory at (www.sell2.illinois.gov/bep/Small_and_Diverse_Businesses.htm), as well as the directories of other certifying agencies but subcontracting vendors must be certified by CMS as BEP vendors before the time of contract award.

Vendor Assurance: The Vendor shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation or sex in the performance of this contract. Failure by the Vendor to carry out these requirements is a material breach of this contract, which may result in the termination of this contract or such other remedy, as the Agency deems appropriate. This assurance must be included in each subcontract that the Vendor signs with a subcontractor or supplier.

Calculating Certified Vendor Participation: The Utilization Plan documents work anticipated to be performed by all certified vendors and paid for upon satisfactory completion. Only the value of payments made for the work actually performed by certified BEP vendors is counted toward the contract goal. Counting guidelines are summarized below:

6.14. The value of the work actually performed by the certified vendor's forces shall be counted towards the goal. The entire amount of that portion of the contract that is performed by the certified vendor's forces, including supplies purchased or equipment leased by the BEP vendor shall be counted, except supplies purchased and equipment rented from the Vendor.

6.15. A joint venture shall count the portion of the total dollar value of the contract equal to the distinct, clearly defined portion of the work of the contract that the certified vendor performs with its forces toward the goal. A joint venture shall also count the dollar value of work subcontracted to other certified vendors. Work performed by the forces of a non-certified joint venture partner shall not be counted toward the goal.

6.16. When a certified vendor subcontracts part of the work of its contract to another firm, the value of the subcontracted work shall be counted toward the contract goal only if the certified vendor's subcontractor is a certified vendor. Work that a certified vendor subcontracts to a non-certified vendor will not count towards the goal.

6.17. A Vendor shall count towards the goal 100% of its expenditures for materials and supplies required under the contract and obtained from a certified vendor manufacturer, regular dealer or supplier.

6.18. A Vendor shall count towards the goal the following expenditures to certified vendors that are not manufacturers, regular dealers or suppliers:

6.18.1. The fees or commissions charged for providing a bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services and assistance in the procurement of essential personnel, facilities, equipment, materials or supplies required for performance of the contract, provided that the fee or commission is determined by the Agency to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services.

Attachment NN - Minority, Female, Persons with Disability Participation and Utilization Plan <page_number>33</page_number>

Page 60
MINORITY, FEMALE, PERSONS WITH DISABILITY STATUS PARTICIPATION AND UTILIZATION PLAN

ATTACHMENT NN

6.18.2. The fees charged for delivery of materials and supplies required by the contract (but not the cost of the materials and supplies themselves) when the hauler, trucker, or delivery service is not also the manufacturer of or a regular dealer in the materials and supplies, provided that the fee is determined by the Agency to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services. The certified vendor trucking firm must be responsible for the management and supervision of the entire trucking operation for which it is responsible on the contract, and must itself own and operate at least one fully licensed, insured and operational truck used on the contract.

6.18.3. The fees or commissions charged for providing any bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of the contract, provided that the fee or commission is determined by the Agency to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services.

6.19. A Vendor shall count towards the goal only expenditures to firms that perform a commercially useful function in the work of the contract.

6.19.1. A firm is considered to perform a commercially useful function when it is responsible for execution of a distinct element of the work of a contract and carries out its responsibilities by actually performing, managing, and supervising the work involved. The certified vendor must also be responsible, with respect to materials or supplies used on the contract, for negotiating price, determining quality and quantity, ordering the materials or supplies, and installing the materials (where applicable) and paying for the material or supplies. To determine whether a firm is performing a commercially useful function, the Agency shall evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, whether the amount the firm is to be paid under the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and the credit claimed for its performance of the work, industry practices, and other relevant factors.

6.19.2. A certified vendor does not perform a commercially useful function if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in a transaction or contract through which funds are passed in order to obtain certified vendor participation. In determining whether a certified vendor is such an extra participant, the Agency shall examine similar transactions, particularly those in which certified vendors do not participate, and industry practices.

6.20. A Vendor shall not count towards the goal expenditures that are not direct, necessary and proximately related to the work of the contract. Only the amount of services or goods that are directly attributable to the performance of the contract shall be counted. Ineligible expenditures include general office overhead or other Vendor support activities.

Good Faith Effort Procedures: If the Vendor cannot meet the goal, the Vendor must document in the Utilization Plan its good faith efforts that could reasonably have been expected to meet the goal. Vendors must submit utilization forms that meet or exceed the published goal or
Attachment NN - Minority, Female, Persons with Disability Participation and Utilization Plan <page_number>34</page_number>

Page 61
MINORITY, FEMALE, PERSONS WITH DISABILITY STATUS PARTICIPATION AND UTILIZATION PLAN

ATTACHMENT NN

submit utilization forms that describe a percentage participation that is less than the goal and submit documentation regarding good faith efforts at the time of bid/proposal submission. Vendors will not be permitted to correct goal deficiencies post bid/proposal due dates. The Agency will consider the quality, quantity, and intensity of the Vendor's efforts.

7.14. The following is a list of types of action that the Agency will consider as evidence of the Vendor's good faith efforts to meet the goal. Other factors or efforts brought to the attention of the Agency may be relevant in appropriate cases.

7.14.1. Soliciting through all reasonable and available means (e.g., attendance at pre-bid meetings, advertising and/or written notices) the interest of all certified vendors that have the capability to perform the work of the contract. The Vendor must solicit this interest within sufficient time to allow the certified vendors to respond to the solicitation. The Vendor must determine with certainty if the certified vendors are interested by taking appropriate steps to follow up initial solicitations and encourage them to bid. The Vendor must provide interested certified vendors with adequate information about the plans, specifications, and requirements of the contract in a timely manner to assist them in responding promptly to the solicitation.

7.14.2. Selecting portions of the work to be performed by certified vendors in order to increase the likelihood that the goal will be achieved. This includes, where appropriate, breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units to facilitate certified vendor participation, even when the Vendor might otherwise prefer to perform these work items with its own forces.

7.14.3. Making a portion of the work available to certified vendors and selecting those portions of the work or material needs consistent with their availability, so as to facilitate certified vendor participation.

7.14.4. Negotiating in good faith with interested certified vendors. Evidence of such negotiation includes the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of certified vendors that were considered; a description of the information provided regarding the plans and specifications for the work selected for subcontracting and evidence as to why additional agreements could not be reached for certified vendors to perform the work. A Vendor using good business judgment will consider a number of factors in negotiating with certified vendors and will take a firm’s price and capabilities into consideration. The fact that there may be some additional costs involved in finding and using certified vendors is not in itself sufficient reason for a Vendor’s failure to meet the goal, as long as such costs are reasonable. Vendors are not required to accept higher quotes from certified vendors if the price difference is excessive or unreasonable.

7.14.5. Thoroughly investigating the capabilities of certified vendors and not rejecting them as unqualified without sound reasons. The certified vendor’s memberships in specific groups, organizations, or associations and political or social affiliations are not legitimate causes for the rejection or non-solicitation of bids in the Vendor’s efforts to meet the goal.

Attachment NN - Minority, Female, Persons with Disability Participation and Utilization Plan <page_number>35</page_number>

Page 62
MINORITY, FEMALE, PERSONS WITH DISABILITY STATUS PARTICIPATION AND UTILIZATION PLAN

ATTACHMENT NN

7.14.6. Making efforts to assist interested certified vendors in obtaining lines of credit or insurance as required by the Agency, the Vendor or to perform the scope of work.

7.14.7. Making efforts to assist interested certified vendors in obtaining necessary equipment, supplies, materials, or related assistance or services.

7.14.8. Effectively using the services of available minority/women community organizations; minority/women vendors’ groups; local, state, and federal minority/women business assistance offices; and other organizations that provide assistance in the recruitment and placement of certified vendors.

7.15. In evaluating the Vendor’s good faith efforts, the good faith efforts of other vendors to meet the goal on this solicitation or similar contracts may be considered.

7.16. If the Agency determines that the Vendor has made good faith efforts to meet the goal, the Agency will award the contract provided that the Vendor is otherwise eligible for award.

7.17. If the Agency determines that good faith efforts have not been made, it will notify the Vendor in writing of that determination.

Contract Compliance: Compliance with this section is an essential part of the contract. The following administrative procedures and remedies govern the Vendor’s compliance with the contractual obligations established by the Utilization Plan. After approval of the Plan and award of the contract, the Utilization Plan becomes part of the contract. If the Vendor did not succeed in obtaining enough certified vendor participation to achieve the goal, and the Utilization Plan was approved and contract awarded based upon a determination of good faith, the total dollar value of certified vendor work calculated in the approved Utilization Plan as a percentage of the awarded contract value shall become the contract goal.
8.1. The Utilization Plan may not be amended without the Agency’s prior written approval.

8.2. The Vendor may not make changes to its contractual BEP certified vendor commitments or substitute BEP certified vendors without the prior written approval of the Agency. Unauthorized changes or substitutions, including performing the work designated for a certified vendor with the Vendor’s own forces, shall be a violation of the utilization plan and a breach of the contract, and shall be cause to terminate the contract, and/or seek other contract remedies or sanctions. The facts supporting the request for changes must not have been known nor reasonably should have been known by the parties prior to entering into the subcontract. The Vendor must negotiate with the certified vendor to resolve the problem. Where there has been a mistake or disagreement about the scope of work, the certified vendor can be substituted only where agreement cannot be reached for a reasonable price or schedule for the correct scope of work.

8.3. Substitutions of a certified vendor shall be permitted under the following circumstances:

8.3.1. Unavailability after receipt of reasonable notice to proceed;

Attachment NN - Minority, Female, Persons with Disability Participation and Utilization Plan <page_number>36</page_number>

Page 63
MINORITY, FEMALE, PERSONS WITH DISABILITY STATUS PARTICIPATION AND UTILIZATION PLAN

ATTACHMENT NN

8.3.2. Failure of performance; 8.3.3. Financial incapacity; 8.3.4. Refusal by the certified vendor to honor the bid or proposal price or scope; 8.3.5. Material mistake of fact or law about the elements of the scope of work of a solicitation where a reasonable price cannot be agreed; 8.3.6. Failure of the certified vendor to meet insurance, licensing or bonding requirements; 8.3.7. The certified vendor's withdrawal of its bid or proposal; or 8.3.8. Decertification of the certified vendor.

8.4. If it becomes necessary to substitute a certified vendor or otherwise change the Utilization Plan, the Vendor must notify the Agency in writing of the request to substitute a certified vendor or otherwise change the Utilization Plan. The request must state specific reasons for the substitution or change. The Agency will approve or deny a request for substitution or other change in the Utilization Plan within 5 business days of receipt of the request.

8.5. Where the Vendor has established the basis for the substitution to the Agency's satisfaction, it must make good faith efforts to meet the contract goal by substituting a certified vendor. Documentation of a replacement vendor, or of good faith efforts to replace the certified vendor, must meet the requirements of the initial Utilization Plan. If the goal cannot be reached and good faith efforts have been made, the Vendor may substitute with a non-certified vendor.

8.6. If a Vendor plans to hire a subcontractor for any scope of work that was not previously disclosed in the Utilization Plan, the Vendor must obtain the approval of the Agency to modify the Utilization Plan and must make good faith efforts to ensure that certified vendors have a fair opportunity to bid on the new scope of work.

8.7. A new subcontract must be executed and submitted to the Agency within 5 business days of the Vendor's receipt of the Agency's approval for the substitution or other change.

8.8. The Vendor shall maintain a record of all relevant data with respect to the utilization of certified vendors, including but without limitation, payroll records, invoices, canceled checks and books of account for a period of at least 5 years after the completion of the contract. Full access to these records shall be granted by the Vendor upon 48 hours written demand by the Agency to any duly authorized representative thereof, or to any municipal, state or federal authorities. The Agency shall have the right to obtain from the Vendor any additional data reasonably related or necessary to verify any representations by the Vendor. After the performance of the final item of work or delivery of material by a certified vendor and final payment to the certified vendor by the Vendor, but not later than 30 calendar days after such payment, the Vendor shall

submit a statement confirming the final payment and the total payments made to the BEP vendor under the contract.

8.9. The Agency will periodically review the Vendor’s compliance with these provisions and the terms of its contract. Without limitation, the Vendor’s failure to comply with these provisions or its contractual commitments as contained in the Utilization Plan, failure to cooperate in providing information regarding its compliance with these provisions or its Utilization Plan, or provision of false or misleading information or statements concerning compliance, certification status or eligibility of certified vendors, good faith efforts or any other material fact or representation shall constitute a material breach of this contract and entitle the Agency to declare a default, terminate the contract, or exercise those remedies provided for in the contract or at law or in equity.

8.10. The Agency reserves the right to withhold payment to the Vendor to enforce these provisions and the Vendor’s contractual commitments. Final payment shall not be made on the contract until the Vendor submits sufficient documentation demonstrating compliance with its Utilization Plan
